# 🏗 Scaffold-Eth Typescript

## Typescript

This is the typescript repo of scaffold-eth and it uses `hardhat` and `vite`. The directories that you'll use are:

```bash
packages/vite-app-ts/
packages/hardhat-ts/
```

## Quick Start

Running the app

1. install your dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. start a hardhat node

   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

3. run the app, `open a new command prompt`

   ```bash
   # build hardhat & external contracts types
   yarn contracts:build 
   # deploy your hardhat contracts
   yarn deploy
   # start the app
   yarn start 
   ```

4. other commands
   ```bash
   # rebuild all contracts, incase of inconsistent state
   yarn contracts:rebuild
   # run hardhat commands for the workspace, or see all tasks
   yarn hardhat 'xxx'
   # run subgraph commands for the workspace
   yarn subgraph 'xxx'
   ```

## Overview

Everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

- 🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat-ts/contracts`
- 📝 Edit your frontend `MainPage.tsx` in `packages/vite-app-ts/src`
- 💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat-ts/deploy`
- 📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app
- 👷🏽‍♂️ run `yarn hardhat` to get a list of all the tasks.  Run `yarn hardhat taskname` to run the task.

## 🔐 P.S.About keys

You need an RPC and API keys for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/vite-app-ts/.env` with your new keys.
